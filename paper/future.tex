Competing leaders? How to switch reliably in this case?
The problem: how to determine the next leader from one Paxos module to the next?
One solution: use an external reconfiguration master.
Other solution: explicitly describe a protocol to do that (a special instance of MultiPaxos just for that?).
The two solutions could build on the same interface: each process gets an indication to switch along with the next config.

How to implement switching policies?
